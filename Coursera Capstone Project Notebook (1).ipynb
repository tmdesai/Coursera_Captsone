Problem\nToday's drivers in Seattle are inundated with several distractions on the road, including changing weather conditions, more drivers being present, city planning, smart phones, and more. With more drivers being on the road today, it is critical for drivers to better understand the various factors that may increase the chance that a driver meets with a severe accident. \n#### Audience: \nThe audience for this analysis will be drivers as well as driving trainers; by having more of this information at hand, drivers can be more cautious and safe given the influence of various factors on driving conditions. \n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### 2.
