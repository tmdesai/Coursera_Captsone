In this final capstone, I will be interested in analyzing the impact that various variables and factors have on predicting car accident severity. My hope is that, with this analysis, the data model can help equip drivers with the knowledge of what to be congnizant of when driving on the road to prevent accidents. This can hopefully save more lives, save driver money on car repairs, and help ensure more drivers aware driving more safely.
